# Absurd Challenge Mode #

Absurd Challenge Mode is a simple overhaul mod for Monster Hunter World intended to make the game experience more difficult in an *absurd* fashion.
There already exists a [hard mode mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/4828) for MHW, but I wanted there to be something more
detailed than only simple damage and speed increases. Thus Absurd Challenge Mode was born! 

*Note: This mod is **not** intended to be used online, or for existing playthroughs. It intended for a **new** playthrough, start to finish.*

# Requirements and Installation #

This mod requires [Stracker's Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/1982) and [Sharp Plugin Loader](https://fexty12573.github.io/SharpPluginLoader/Install/Installation.html).


As with most MHW mods, installation is very simple: Just download the latest release and copy the nativePC folder onto *your* nativePC
folder in your MHW game directory. If ACMPlugin.dll is in nativePC/plugins/CSharp, then you did it correctly!

I also *highly* recommend [Cutscene Skip](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/5540), as this mod is designed for a new playthrough.

# General Changes #

There'll be a more detailed list of changes at the end, but I recommend just jumping straight in if you do plan to try this mod out!

### Weapon Movesets and Values ###
- (Almost) All weapons have been *nerfed* in some capacity through changes to their movesets or motion values.

The same tactics you use in vanilla may no longer work here!

### Bowgun Defense ###
- Rather than modify bowgun movesets, their defense modifier has simply been reduced to zero.

- Bow has received a slight buff to charging sidestep iframes as compensation for not being LBG or HBG.

### Monster Behavior and Values ###
Perhaps the core of this mod: Almost *every* required monster has changes **unique** to them.

- Certain monsters may now perform different attacks or attack combos, some may have their speed, damage, size, or shape changed (possibly mid-fight!),
and in many cases the speed of *certain attacks* is changed, so watch out!

### Decoration Drop Rates ###
Decoration drop rates have been... changed. For the worse. You'll understand what I mean when you get there.

- All you need to know is that you can no longer rely on decorations for good skills, so focus on making armor!

### Clutch claw effectiveness ###
- Clutch claw stagger (also known as "clagger") is turned off in this mod.

- Additionally, the duration of the tenderizing effect has been reverted to its release Iceborne value, 90 seconds. Please enjoy.
