# Absurd Challenge Mode #

Absurd Challenge Mode is a simple overhaul mod for Monster Hunter World intended to make the game experience more difficult in an *absurd* fashion.
There already exists a [hard mode mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/4828) for MHW, but I wanted there to be something more
detailed than only simple damage and speed increases. Thus Absurd Challenge Mode was born! 

On a broad level, this mod changes:
- Weapon movesets
- Monster behavior
- General monster speed/damage/size/shape
- Monster speed *for specific behaviors*
- Decoration drop rates
